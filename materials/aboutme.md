My name is Xiang Xie (Xiang is pronounced like Shawn). I am the co-founder of [PADO Labs](https://padolabs.org/). My interest lies in applied cryptography, with a particular focus on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). I received grants from [PSE](https://pse.dev/).
